# DatabaseApp
Database application designed for a retail gaming store. (Incomplete)

This files herein are meant to be included in the www folder of a PHP Desktop application. 

The page logic meant to be followed is the following order:

index.php -> loginProcess.php -> home.php -> managementPage.php -> databaseTables.php

Other sections of the application which have links in the header are not complete but placeholders. Depending on what the user
does at this point different actions take place beginning with EditableGrid.php and loaddata.php after. From here add.php,
update.php, or delete.php may be called. These are to perform database operations based on the privileges of the user who is currently
logged in.

Pictures and GIFS of the application features in operation are included in the Wiki for this repository.
